# Our application
Our application is a platform designed for the VR gaming community, where users can interact with others who share their passion for virtual reality technology.Built with React + Vite and styled using the Material UI library, our focus has been on delivering a visually appealing and intuitive interface for users. It was designed for users to engage with fellow VR gaming enthusiasts, explore trending forums, and stay updated on the latest VR gaming discussions.
The home page showcases trending forums where users can explore various topics. Upon clicking on a forum, users can delve into the latest posts, participate in discussions, and subscribe to stay connected with communities of interest. 
From their profile page, users can also view their subscribed forums and manage their subscriptions. 
The application also features a login system that allows users to access their subscribed forums and post comments,upload images or  videos.
